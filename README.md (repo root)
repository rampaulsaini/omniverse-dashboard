# Omniverse Dashboard

Single-file static dashboard + helper scripts to aggregate and monitor several GitHub Pages sites for the `rampaulsaini` account.

## Features
- Live iframe preview (browser)
- GitHub repo metadata (via GitHub API) — server-side or browser with CORS limitations
- Health checks, link-checker, and lightweight static analysis
- Example GitHub Actions workflow to deploy & run audits

## How to use
1. Place `index.html` at repo root and `scripts/` folder alongside it.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository (if you want the dashboard live).
4. Optionally configure `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to run audits on push.

## Local usage (Node)
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install node-fetch@2 cheerio

# Omniverse AI Marketplace (Zero-cost)

This repo contains a zero-cost AI tools marketplace designed to run on GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Put files into a repository (branch `main`).
2. Push and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages) with branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
3. Open `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Owner setup (zero-cost monetization)
- Click "Donate / Pay" → add your PayPal / Ko-fi / UPI details (stored in browser localStorage).
- When a buyer pays externally, provide them a one-time unlock key (set in Settings → Owner: Set Premium Key).
- Buyer enters the unlock key locally (currently not implemented UI for entering key — owner can share key; premium key presence allows downloads).

## Replace mock AI with real provider
- All tools are client-side mock generators in `scripts/tools.js`.
- Replace tool.run implementations with fetch calls to OpenAI / HuggingFace or your own serverless functions.
- For production API keys, use serverless endpoints (do NOT embed keys in client-side JS).

## Next steps (I can implement)
- Serverless payment verification (Stripe/PayPal) + automatic unlock key issuing
- Replace mock AI outputs with real OpenAI / HF inference (via serverless)
- Add email automation, order management, simple admin UI
